# Method Reference
Here at SmartPlaces, we're commited to the *transparency* and *comprehensibility* of our tech - two very important values of Open Source software development.   
Below, we maintain a  list of all functions and methods used in the Smart Places Protocol Smart Contract, during its operation -- along with their description.

## Operation Flowcharts

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Duis tempor varius vulputate. Curabitur efficitur at libero vel ultrices. Pellentesque eget ipsum ultricies, ullamcorper dolor eu, tincidunt risus.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
